# Action Automator

Action Automator is a productivity extension for Chrome. You can record series
of actions and replay them with only a press of a button.

# Development

The code is written in coffescript. You will need a coffeescript compiler to
build the js files. If you have the standard coffeescript compiler installed,
you can simply run `cake build`.
